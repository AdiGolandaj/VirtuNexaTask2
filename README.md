# The Second Task given by VirtuNexa
## A Website for a virtual store called ShoeSpace
Just another landing page coming to life after 2 days worth of work.

### Development process thought process
Tbh I was going to go at this absolutely randomly, but then i decided, why not make my already difficult life even more difficult by just taking a random detour and trying to work with something called Server side rendering. Didn't get the whole thing but let me explain it to you in some simpler words 

```
All products stored in DB -> Fetch all of them -> make a component using props -> just call the component for every product in store.
```
Sounds Easy Right.... But then... I met Java SpringBoot
(being this close to giving up on life)
